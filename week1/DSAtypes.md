# DATA STRUCTURES (DS)

There are other types of data structures other than Arrays and Linked List that was explained in class. Below are three (3) other data structures with visual representation and real world example.

## Stacks:
This is a linear type of data structure that follows the First In Last Out (FILO) or Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It allows insertion and deletion from only one end of the stack.

### Real Life Example:
Pile of Plates in a plate rack.



## Queues:
This is an abstract data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) or Last In Last Out (LILO) principle. It is open at both ends of the stack.

### Real Life Example:
Cars moving in one lane, queue for tickets at a bus-stop.


## Hash Tables:
A hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which the element will be.

### Real Life Example:
If you have a list of 20000 numbers, and you have given a number to search in that list- you will scan each number in the list until you find a match.


## Trees:
A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search.

### Real Life Example:
A company's hierarchy. Each employee has a boss all the way up to the CEO. Each person represents a node
